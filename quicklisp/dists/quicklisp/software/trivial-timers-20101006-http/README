Trivial Timers -- Portable timers for Common Lisp

This exports the SBCL Timer interface and not much else. The portable
implementation requires a Bordeaux threads snapshot from at least
December 2008.

The portable implementation is based upon the SBCL implementation and
as such remains in the public domain.
